# fejord-language
fejord is a constructed language (conlang) that aims to be as natural as possible. Its main source of inspiration was Latin, borrowing ideas like multiple declensions and conjugations cases for nouns and verb. A smaller, less significant source of inspiration was the Great Vowel Shift, more specifically, shortening the ending "i" to "Éª".
