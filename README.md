# fejord-language
fejord is a constructed language (conlang) that aims to be as natural as possible. Its main source of inspiration is Latin, borrowing ideas like multiple declensions and conjugation cases for nouns and verbs. A smaller, less significant source of inspiration is the Great Vowel Shift, more specifically, shortening the ending "i" to "Éª".
